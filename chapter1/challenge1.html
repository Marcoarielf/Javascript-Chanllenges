    /*

    Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
    calculated using the formula:
    BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
    and height in meter).

    Your tasks:
    1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
    2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
    versions)
    3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
    whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
    Test data:
    ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
    m tall.
    ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
    m tall.
